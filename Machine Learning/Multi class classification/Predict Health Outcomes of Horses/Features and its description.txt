surgery - had surgery/ no
age - Adult horse 2 = Young (< 6 months)

hospital number - numeric id - the case number assigned to the horse (may not be unique if the horse is treated > 1 time)

rectal_temp - linear - in degrees celsius. - An elevated temp may occur due to infection

pulse - the heart rate in beats per minute - is a reflection of the heart condition

respiratory_rate - normal rate is 8 to 10 - usefulness is doubtful due to the great fluctuations

temp_of_extremities - a subjective indication of peripheral circulation - possible values: 1 = Normal 2 = Warm 3 = Cool 4 = Cold

peripheral_pulse - subjective - possible values are: 1 = normal 2 = increased 3 = reduced 4 = absent

mucous_membrane - a subjective measurement of colour - possible values are: 1 = normal pink 2 = bright pink 3 = pale pink 4 = pale cyanotic 5 = bright red / injected 6 = dark cyanotic - 1 and 2 probably indicate a normal or slightly increased circulation - 3 may occur in early shock - 4 and 6 are indicative of serious circulatory compromise - 5 is more indicative of a septicemia

capillary_refill_time - a clinical judgement. The longer the refill, the poorer the circulation - possible values 1 = < 3 seconds 2 = >= 3 seconds

pain - possible values: 1 = alert, no pain 2 = depressed 3 = intermittent mild pain 4 = intermittent severe pain 5 = continuous severe pain - should NOT be treated as a ordered or discrete variable! - In general, the more painful, the more likely it is to require surgery - prior treatment of pain may mask the pain level to some extent

peristalsis - an indication of the activity in the horse's gut. As the gut becomes more distended or the horse becomes more toxic, the activity decreases - possible values: 1 = hypermotile 2 = normal 3 = hypomotile 4 = absent

abdominal_distention - An IMPORTANT parameter.- possible values 1 = none 2 = slight 3 = moderate 4 = severe - an animal with abdominal distension is likely to be painful and have reduced gut motility. - a horse with severe abdominal distension is likely to require surgery just to relieve the pressure

nasogastric_tube - this refers to any gas coming out of the tube - possible values: 1 = none 2 = slight 3 = significant - a large gas cap in the stomach is likely to give the horse discomfort

nasogastric_reflux - possible values 1 = none 2 = > 1 liter 3 = < 1 liter - the greater amount of reflux, the more likelihood that there is some serious obstruction to the fluid passage from the rest of the intestine

nasogastric_reflux_ph - linear - scale is from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral - normal values are in the 3 to 4 range

rectal_exam_feces - possible values 1 = normal 2 = increased 3 = decreased 4 = absent - absent feces probably indicates an obstruction

abdomen - possible values 1 = normal 2 = other 3 = firm feces in the large intestine 4 = distended small intestine 5 = distended large intestine - 3 is probably an obstruction caused by a mechanical impaction and is normally treated medically - 4 and 5 indicate a surgical lesion

packed_cell_volume - linear - the # of red cells by volume in the blood - normal range is 30 to 50. The level rises as the circulation becomes compromised or as the animal becomes dehydrated.

total_protein - linear - normal values lie in the 6-7.5 (gms/dL) range - the higher the value the greater the dehydration

abdomo_appearance - a needle is put in the horse's abdomen and fluid is obtained from the abdominal cavity - possible values: 1 = clear 2 = cloudy 3 = serosanguinous - normal fluid is clear while cloudy or serosanguinous indicates a compromised gut

abdomo_protein - linear - the higher the level of protein the more likely it is to have a compromised gut. Values are in gms/dL

outcome - what eventually happened to the horse? - possible values: 1 = lived 2 = died 3 = was euthanized

surgical_lesion - retrospectively, was the problem (lesion) surgical? - all cases are either operated upon or autopsied so that this value and the lesion type are always known - possible values: 1 = Yes 2 = No

lesion_1 - first number is site of lesion 1 = gastric 2 = sm intestine 3 = lg colon 4 = lg colon and cecum 5 = cecum 6 = transverse colon 7 = retum/descending colon 8 = uterus 9 = bladder 11 = all intestinal sites 00 = none

lesion_2 - second number is type 1 = simple 2 = strangulation 3 = inflammation 4 = other

lesion_3 - third number is subtype 1 = mechanical 2 = paralytic 0 = n/a - fourth number is specific code 1 = obturation 2 = intrinsic 3 = extrinsic 4 = adynamic 5 = volvulus/torsion 6 = intussuption 7 = thromboembolic 8 = hernia 9 = lipoma/slenic incarceration 10 = displacement 0 = n/a

cp_data- is pathology data present for this case? 1 = Yes 2 = No
