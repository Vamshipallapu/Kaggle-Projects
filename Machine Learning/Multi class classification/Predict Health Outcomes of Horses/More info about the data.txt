The packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein (TP) is a simple yet informative laboratory test, but one that is often misinterpreted or under-utilised.

It is important to remember that all test results need to be interpreted in the light of the patient’s history, presenting clinical signs and general physical examination findings.

Below is a table of the various changes that can be found on a PCV/TP and the possible causes of these changes. Many of the differentials can be include or excluded based on the history, clinical signs and examination findings.


Shock in horses is the same as it is in humans. It is the body’s own survival mechanism when it feels death is imminent. Essentially, the circulatory system shuts down, causing a sudden drop in blood circulation and blood pressure.

“There is not enough blood to fill the blood vessels, or all the blood vessels dilate at the same time,” explained Dr. Vanessa Scanlan, a large animal veterinarian with Fundy Veterinarians, located in Shubenacadie and Truro, Nova Scotia. “If you had a pool that all of a sudden had a leak, you wouldn’t have enough water to fill the pool. It’s kind of the same thing. The effect is that there’s not enough blood to pump up the vessels that need to be pumped up.”

Deprived of oxygen and nutrients, the organs begin to fail. If the shock isn’t treated, the horse will eventually lose consciousness, the heart will stop and the horse will die.

Horses suffer shock for a number of reasons including injury, colic, extreme fear, blood loss and dehydration.
